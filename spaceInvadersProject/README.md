# spaceInvadersProject
This game is based on Dave Kerr's Space Invaders JavaScript Tutorial. While this version includes many additional features and mechanics, the code is derived from his tutorial. Please checkout the original tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/spaceinvaders">GitHub</a> and on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/681130/Learn-JavaScript-Part-Space-Invaders">Code Project</a>
<br><p>Space Invaders JS is entirely written using front end JavaScript and jQuery. The game is able to remember a user's initials and high scores by utilizing localStorage.
